Note that for you to be able to run this chart on bare metal (as intended),
your cluster should also feature some load balancing mechanism which also
allows for the Ingress to be assigned with a static IP.
For example, with MetalLB, we could configure the static ip provisioning
to work as follows:

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
    namespace: metallb-system
    name: config
    data:
    config: |
        address-pools:
        - name: default
        protocol: layer2
        addresses:     
        - <YOUR_IP_RANGE_START>-<YOUR_IP_RANGE_END>
